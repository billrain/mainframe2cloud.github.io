If I ask you a layman question:
>What is the difference between a computer server and PC?

A quick but distinctive answer I can give is, a server is able to handle multiple different workload for multiple users simultaneously. In pro IT words, server can virtualize its underlying hardware resources to serve different environments, systems or even multiple tenant of customers.

Cloud computing has been the great adoption of massive virtualization where customers donâ€™t need to purchase their own physical computer hardware or even software. But long before cloud was introduced in 2006 and widely used commercial virtualization hypervisor like VMware was founded in 1998, computing platform virtualization had evolved from mainframe OS since its 1st generation of OS/360 on S/360. In a nutshell, virtualization has gone through below stages: multiple addresses in one OS -> virtual instance (LPAR) -> clustering (parallel sysplex) -> cloud -> container (docker, K8S)

The mainframe in the 1960s is pretty much similar to desktop PC we use today, a monitor as terminal display, keyboard and printer as input and output, and data is stored on storage system and processed by CPU. The operating system allows user to perform multiple tasks at the same time like writing this blog and surfing internet using different applications concurrently, in mainframe, such application runs in its own virtual storage called address space (System tasks also called STC, batch as JOB). ie one DB2 or CICS instance runs in independent address space with isolated real and virtual memory allocated. The early version of mainframe OS - Multiple Virtual Storage serves as the Unix Kernal to manage the data access and control memory swapping.

Mainframe is called *Dinosaur* not because it is old, also because it is monster in terms of owning resources. It was designed to serve enterprise customers who may have dozens of departments, application systems and environments like dev and production. It is compulsory for such resource monster to divide and isolate computing powers into smaller independent partitions so small group of users can run their own workload in contained manner.

## VM

Believe or not, the original virtualization wasn't hardware built-in hypervisor, but the OS level virtual machine CP/CMS (branded to z/VM) developed in the 1960s,  the common known type-1 hypervisor of mainframe - PR/SM (Processor Resource/System Manager) was only introduced in the 1990s, probably that's when people started to use LPAR (logical partition) to refer a mainframe system. Today, we have 2 main types of hypervisors, **type 1** (bare metal) runs directly with host hardware, or **type 2** runs as software on the host OS.

PR/SM is shipped with mainframe machines which acts as type 1 hypervisor, z/VM can be purchased and installed on one LPAR to act as type 2 hypervisor and host thousands of guest VMs like Linux. Back in 2007 when I first created a z/OS image on z/VM using scripts, I could not image it will be called *Infra as Code* after 10years and became standard of 'modern' infra. z/VM back then was able to segment an entire disk volume (DASD) into dozens of mini disks as virtualized DASD volume to boot up z/OS guest VM. Although it is not like today, we can assign 10GB persistent storage to a cloud VM using web console, the concept is similar.

If I ask you a layman question:
>What is the difference between a computer server and PC?

A quick but distinctive answer I can give is, a server is able to handle multiple different workload for multiple users simultaneously. In pro IT words, server can virtualize its underlying hardware resources to serve different environments, systems or even multiple tenant of customers.  

Cloud computing has been the great adoption of massive virtualization where customers donâ€™t need to purchase their own physical computer hardware or even software. But long before cloud was introduced in 2006 and widely used commercial virtualization hypervisor like VMware was founded in 1998, computing platform virtualization had evolved from mainframe OS since its 1st generation of OS/360 on S/360. In a nutshell, virtualization has gone through below stages: multiple address space in one OS -> virtual instance (LPAR) -> clustering (parallel sysplex) -> cloud -> container (docker, K8S)

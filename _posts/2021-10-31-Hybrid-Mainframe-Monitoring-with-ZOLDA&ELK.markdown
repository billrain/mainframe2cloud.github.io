IBM announced their hybrid operational analytics solution on Sep 2021 which merged two products ZLDA and ZCDP into [Z Operational Log and Data Analytics](https://www.ibm.com/products/z-log-and-data-analytics) (ZOLDA).
According to IBM:
>...near real-time IBM ZÂ® operational data is streamed to an enterprise analytics platform, or the included log analysis platform, or both.

The true beauty of this software is enabling data analytic solutions on distributed platform like ELK or Splunk to ingest Mainframe ops data and logs.  Almost all mainframe ops data captured by SMF and logging can be streamed by ZOLDA and piped to data analytic engine outside platform z, like:
* RMF (70-79), SMF30, CICS (110-112), DB2(101-102)
* MVS SYSLOG/OPERLOG
* USS log(syslogd)
* CICS MSGUSR
* STC log or batch log

Mainframe being one of the most well established computing platform has dominated commercial computing for decades, it has the capability to 'log everything', every system/application events, every DB query, every minor state change of a service, are either logged as plain text or recoded by System management facilities (SMF) as non-readable data. To read data collected by SMF, user need to use utility programs developed by IBM or other software vendors for their proprietary software, like DFHSTUP/DFH$MOLS for CICS, else user can use MXG with SAS to generate meaningful reports with pre-defined layouts. For decades, IBM hasn't allowed SMF data to overflow to distributed platform as readable format until the ZOLDA's predecessor Z Common Data Provider (ZCDP). With ZOLDA or ZCDP, SMF data are parsed as CSV format and piped off the mainframe platform, I have to acknowledge my admire to the bold move of such intuitive for data democratization. Data as the new fuel for digital era, can be grasped tightly as black hole (only in, no out), or can be shared and consumed without boundary, embracing the open technologies is not an easy but future proven strategy.

I have the privilege to order this product on the day of GA and install the software even before user guide is released, and have used the ZOLDA with ELK for couples of weeks of first hands experience. I am going to share my use case in 3 parts:
1. Overview of ZOLDA (this article)
2. Installation and customisation of ZOLDA and ELK
3. Index and dashboard in ELK with mainframe data

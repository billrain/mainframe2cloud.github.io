IBM announced their hybrid operational analytics solution on Sep 2021 which merged two products ZLDA and ZCDP into [Z Operational Log and Data Analytics](https://www.ibm.com/products/z-log-and-data-analytics) (ZOLDA).
According to IBM:
>To do this, near real-time IBM ZÂ® operational data is streamed to an enterprise analytics platform, or the included log analysis platform, or both.

The true beauty of this software is enabling data analytic solutions on distributed platform like ELK or Splunk to ingest Mainframe ops data and logs.  

I have the change to order this product on the day of GA and install the software even before user guide is released.

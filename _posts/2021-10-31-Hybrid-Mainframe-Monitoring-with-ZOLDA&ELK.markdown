IBM announced their hybrid operational analytics solution on Sep 2021 which merged two products ZLDA and ZCDP into [Z Operational Log and Data Analytics](https://www.ibm.com/products/z-log-and-data-analytics) (ZOLDA).
According to IBM:
>...near real-time IBM ZÂ® operational data is streamed to an enterprise analytics platform, or the included log analysis platform, or both.

The true beauty of this software is enabling data analytic solutions on distributed platform like ELK or Splunk to ingest Mainframe ops data and logs.  Almost all mainframe ops data captured by SMF and logging can be streamed by ZOLDA and piped to data analytic engine outside platform z, like:
* RMF (70-79), SMF30, CICS (110-112), DB2(101-102)
* MVS SYSLOG/OPERLOG
* USS log(syslogd)
* CICS MSGUSR
* STC log or batch log

Mainframe being one of the most well established computing platform has dominated commercial computing for decades, it has the capability to 'log everything', every system/application event, every DB query, every minor state change of a service, are either logged as plain text or recoded by System management facilities (SMF) as MF-readable only data. To read data collected by SMF, user need to use utility programs developed by IBM or other software vendors for their proprietary software, like DFHSTUP/DFH$MOLS for CICS, else user can use MXG with SAS to generate meaningful reports with pre-defined layouts. For decades, IBM hasn't allowed SMF data to overflow to distributed platform as readable format until the ZOLDA's predecessor Z Common Data Provider (ZCDP). With ZOLDA or ZCDP, SMF data are parsed as CSV format and piped off the mainframe platform, I have to acknowledge my admire to the bold move of such intuitive for data democratization. Data as the new fuel for digital era, can be grasped tightly as black hole (only in, no out), or can be shared and consumed without boundary, embracing the open technologies is not an easy but future proven strategy.

I have the privilege to order this product on the day of GA and install the software even before user guide is released, and have gained some first hands experience after couples of weeks' playing with ZOLDA and ELK for couples. I am going to share my use case in 3 parts:
1. Overview of ZOLDA (this article)
2. Installation and customisation of ZOLDA and ELK
3. Index and dashboard in ELK with mainframe data

## Overview
ZOLDA based on ZCDP prodives data insights for hybrid monitoring and real time incident detection, it streams IBM Z ops data in near real time to one or multiple analytic consumers like ELK, Splunk or data receiver like Kafka, Humio.

## Architecture
In general, ZOLDA has 5 STC running in Mainframe, 3 of them are data collector/streamer, and the other 2 are web config tool server.

A lightweigh setup below shows the SMF data is collected by System Data Engine (SDE), and log data is collected by Log Forwarder, the 2 STC are connected to Data Streamer (DS) via MVS TCPIP, DS has one port exposed to outside Linux or Win server where ELK/Spunk is hosted. To config ZOLDA, it provides a web server based on Liberty JVM, a Liberty angel process is required for authencaction, the other STC is the Liberty JVM. The web config tool is a GUI tool to define data sources and subsribers. Another port is exposed by config tool for system engineers to access the web GUI using their RACF/ACF2 credentials. So total 2 mainframe TCP ports need to be opened.

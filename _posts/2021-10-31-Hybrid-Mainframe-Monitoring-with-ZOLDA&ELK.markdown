IBM announced their hybrid operational analytics solution on Sep 2021 which merged two products ZLDA and ZCDP into [Z Operational Log and Data Analytics][https://www.ibm.com/products/z-log-and-data-analytics] (ZOLDA). According to IBM:
`To do this, near real-time IBM ZÂ® operational data is streamed to an enterprise analytics platform, or the included log analysis platform, or both.`
The true beauty of this software is enabling data analytic solutions on distributed platform like ELK or Splunk to ingest Mainframe ops data and logs.  

I have the change to order this product on the day of GA and install the software even before user guide is released.
